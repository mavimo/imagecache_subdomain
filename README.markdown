Imagecache subdomain
====================

Introduction
------------

This module is a extension for imagecache module to use subdomain
to serve image generated by imagecache. You can define multiple
subdomain and serve image from that (using specific subdomain for
image).

Why use it
----------

Using imagecache_subdomain you can improve your front end loading
performance. Each browser can download only 2 different file from
each subdomain together; if you use different subdomain for images
your browser can dowload much file together and complete page loading
faster then only one domain.
